Various fancy shaders for GZDoom ported from MariENB.

### Luma Sharpen

Boosts small details. Doesn't cause noticeable halos like a typical sharpening
filter.

### Color Grading Suite

Control over RGB gamma/intensity, along with a "tint" filter that, with a
negative intensity, can also be used as a color booster (dunno how this even
works, I wrote it 7 years ago lol). On top of all that, you can also do the
same for saturation and value (not hue because that would just be dumb).

### Color Matrix

General purpose color mixing. The matrix is normalized in post. For experienced
users.

### Hue-Saturation

The GIMP filter in shader form. Allows shifting the hue and tweaking the
saturation and value of red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and magenta ranges.

### BlurSharpShift

Blurring followed by sharpening, followed by chromatic aberration. This is a
meme filter chain that a lot of people love for some reason, claiming it adds
"photorealism" or something.

### Grain

Makes the screen fuzzy. A couple parameters can be tweaked freely.

### Screen Dirt

Overlays a noisy pattern onto the screen to make it filthy. Not a very good
filter, tbh, but I just kept it in for historical reasons.

### Vignette

Darkens the edges of the screen. Comes with "border blur", which also blurs
said edges.

### Palette Reduction w/ Dither

Part of the "Retro FX" megashader from old MariENB versions. Does what it says
on the tin. There's a multitude of palettes available to choose from. Most
IWADs are covered, along with some notable megawads, various DOS games, and a
couple "standard" palettes.
